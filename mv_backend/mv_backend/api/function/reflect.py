Insights into conversational styles(e.g., Sociable), interests(e.g., soccer).
Insights:
    Information about *{opponent}*’s interests.
    Information about the topic *{opponent}* is curious about.
    The *{opponent}*'s conversation style must be chosen from the following options (options : Extroverted(외향적): This child actively seeks out interactions with others and eagerly responds to others' initiatives. They thrive in social settings and are comfortable engaging with different people. Even with limited words or when facing communication challenges, they persist in their efforts to connect with others. Their enthusiasm for social engagement often leads them to initiate conversations and activities, displaying a natural ease in interacting with those around them.
, Introverted(내향적): In contrast, this child tends to respond more than initiate interactions. They may be labeled as "shy" and typically require time to feel comfortable in new environments or around new people. Their attempts at communication might go unnoticed as they prefer observing before participating actively. Difficulties in communication can affect their confidence, making them less likely to initiate interactions. However, they can be deeply engaged and thoughtful conversationalists once they feel at ease.
, Imaginative(상상력): This child actively engages in interactions, displaying a vibrant imagination in their conversations and activities.Usually seek out interactions to satisfy their curiosity.They initiate interactions and respond enthusiastically, infusing creativity into their communication. Their imaginative nature leads them to enjoy storytelling, creative play, and exploring various possibilities in their interactions. They often bring a sense of wonder and creativity to their social engagements, making interactions dynamic and imaginative.
, Intuitive(직관적): In contrast, this child might not always initiate interactions but demonstrates a deep intuitive understanding of their surroundings and people. While they may be more reserved in social situations, they possess a remarkable ability to perceive emotions and nuances. When they do engage, their interactions are marked by thoughtfulness and insight, showcasing their intuitive understanding of others' feelings and the environment.
, Aggressive(공격적): Children with this communication style tend to assert themselves forcefully in interactions. They might initiate communication or respond assertively, often dominating conversations or activities. Their expressions can be intense, sometimes coming off as confrontational or overly assertive. This behavior might stem from frustration, a desire for control, or an attempt to establish dominance. They might interrupt conversations, use strong language, or display physical aggression to communicate their needs or desires. This communication style may require guidance and support to channel their energy and assertiveness positively.
, Polite(예의바른): This child demonstrates a respectful and considerate approach in their interactions with others. They are attentive to social norms, use courteous language, and show good manners. They tend to wait for their turn to speak, listen actively, and respond thoughtfully. Their communication style reflects a genuine effort to be kind and considerate to others, often using phrases like "please" and "thank you" and showing empathy in their interactions.
, Impolite(무례한): In contrast, this child's communication style may come across as rude or lacking in social niceties. They might interrupt conversations frequently, ignore social cues, or use language that is considered disrespectful. Their interactions might seem abrupt or dismissive, showing less regard for others' feelings or social expectations. This behavior might stem from a lack of awareness rather than intentional rudeness, requiring guidance and coaching to understand and employ more appropriate communication manners.
   Information about the topic of conversation between {name} and {opponent}.

What are the {name}'s high-level insights about {opponent} can be inferred from the above statement?
For interest, conversation style parts, you should refer to the sentences spoken by {opponent}.
example:
    interest: soccer, spacecraft, game
    conversation style: Extroverted
output format:
    interest: (noun)
    conversation style: (noun)
